# Aminoacid-prediction

Here I used an Lstm to predict the next amino acid in a sequence of amino acids that go to form proteins. I then do analysis on protein structures in order to capture properties of various protein structures.

The project is based on this paper https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0598-1
